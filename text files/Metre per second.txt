Metre per second
The metre per second is the unit of both speed (scalar quantity) and velocity (vector quantity (which have direction and magnitude)) in the International System of Units (SI), equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in a time of one second.
The SI unit symbols are m/s, m·s−1, m s−1, or m/s. Sometimes it is abbreviated as "mps".

Relation to other measures
The benz, named in honour of Karl Benz, has been proposed as a name for one metre per second. Although it has seen some support as a practical unit, primarily from German sources, it was rejected as the SI unit of velocity and has not seen widespread use or acceptance.
