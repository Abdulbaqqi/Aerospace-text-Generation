Newton (unit)
The newton (symbol: N) is the unit of force in the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as 1 kg⋅m/s2
,
the force which gives a mass of 1 kilogram an acceleration of 1 metre per second per second. It is named after
Isaac Newton in recognition of his work on classical mechanics, specifically Newton's second law of motion.

Definition
A newton is defined as 1 kg⋅m/s2
 (it is a derived unit which is defined in terms of the SI base units). One
newton is therefore the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one metre per second
squared in the direction of the applied force. The units "metre per second squared" can be understood as
measuring a rate of change in velocity per unit of time, i.e. an increase in velocity by 1 metre per second every
second.
In 1946, Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) Resolution 2 standardized the unit of force in the
MKS system of units to be the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 metre per
second squared. In 1948, the 9th CGPM Resolution 7 adopted the name newton for this force. The MKS
system then became the blueprint for today's SI system of units. The newton thus became the standard unit of
force in the Système international d'unités (SI), or International System of Units.
The newton is named after Isaac Newton. As with every SI unit named for a person, its symbol starts with an
upper case letter (N), but when written in full it follows the rules for capitalisation of a common noun; i.e.,
"newton" becomes capitalised at the beginning of a sentence and in titles, but is otherwise in lower case.
In more formal terms, Newton's second law of motion states that the force exerted on an object is directly
proportional to the acceleration hence acquired by that object, thus:
where m represents the mass of the object undergoing an acceleration a . As a result, the newton may be
defined in terms of the kilogram (kg), metre (m), and second (s) as

Examples
At average gravity on Earth (conventionally, g = 9.806 65 m/s2), a kilogram mass exerts a force of about
9.8 newtons. An average-sized apple exerts about one newton of force at Earth's surface, which we measure as
the apple's weight on Earth.
1 N = 0.10197 kg × 9.80665 m/s2 (0.101 97 kg = 101.97 g).
The weight of an average adult exerts a force of about 608 N.
608 N = 62 kg × 9.80665 m/s2 (where 62 kg is the world average adult mass).


Kilonewtons
It is common to see forces expressed in kilonewtons (kN), where 1 kN = 1000 N. For example, the tractive
effort of a Class Y steam train locomotive and the thrust of an F100 jet engine are both around 130 kN.
One kilonewton, 1 kN, is equivalent to 102.0 kgf, or about 100 kg of load under Earth gravity.
1 kN = 102 kg × 9.81 m/s2.
So for example, a platform that shows it is rated at 321 kilonewtons (72,000 lbf) will safely support a 32,100-
kilogram (70,800 lb) load.
Specifications in kilonewtons are common in safety specifications for:
the holding values of fasteners, Earth anchors, and other items used in the building industry;
working loads in tension and in shear;
rock-climbing equipment;
thrust of rocket engines, Jet engines and launch vehicles;
clamping forces of the various moulds in injection-moulding machines used to manufacture plastic parts.
